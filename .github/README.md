# Dotfiles
Configs for softwares I use daily. (except for [dwm](https://github.com/nimaaskarian/dwm)
and [st](https://github.com/nimaaskarian/st). they have their own repo)
## Window managers
### Hyprland
I use hyprland now. my new favorite window manager. It has two type of window management, dwm-like and bspwm-like. I use dwm master stack layout but dwindle mode is also configured. can be changed in the hyprland config.
### i3
I used i3 before hyprland. Its configured with picom, its a sweet, likable and not-so-minimal but good looking setup if you're into Xorg.
### openbox
It has a minimal config and I used to use it for my gaming.
### bspwm
default config :(
## Editors
### LunarVim
with some configs.
## File managers
### nnn
nnn configured with zshrc variables.
### ranger
ranger configured with its own config file. It has everything you may want from a file manager.
## Other stuff
### waybar
### swww
### wal.sh
### wallpaper picker (dmenu/rofi)
### mic toggler (dmenu/rofi)
### and more useful bash and py [scripts](https://github.com/nimaaskarian/dotfiles/tree/master/Scripts)!
