I use hyprland now. my new favorite window manager. It has two type of window management, dwm-like and bspwm-like. I use dwm master stack layout but dwindle mode is also configured. can be changed in the hyprland config.
### i3 (pywal)
I used i3 before hyprland. Its configured with picom, its a sweet, likable and not-so-minimal but good looking setup if you're into Xorg.
### openbox
It has a minimal config and I used to use it for my gaming.
## Editors
### LunarVim
with some configs.
### doom emacs
I love doom emacs. I can edit my bidi and Farsi files in it :D   
Ofc, its been setup with pywal. but nothing else really
## File managers
### nnn
nnn configured with zshrc variables.
### ranger
ranger configured with its own config file. It has everything you may want from a file manager.
